# Advanced Content Update Refresher

Automatically refresh and update WordPress post publish or modified dates on flexible schedules to support structured content maintenance and SEO freshness signals.

---

## Overview

Advanced Content Update Refresher automatically updates WordPress post publish dates or modified timestamps using flexible scheduling options.

The plugin is designed for website owners, SEO professionals, bloggers, and content marketing teams who want to maintain content freshness in a structured and automated way.

Rather than manually editing old posts, this plugin allows you to define update intervals and automatically refresh timestamps in a controlled and transparent manner.

## Why Content Freshness Matters

Search engines evaluate several freshness-related signals, including:

- Last modified date  
- Publish date  
- XML sitemap `lastmod` entries  
- Crawl frequency and update patterns  

Refreshing evergreen content can help maintain crawl activity and keep structured content archives technically up to date.

**Important:**  
This plugin does not manipulate rankings. Sustainable SEO performance always requires meaningful content updates and high-quality information.

## How It Works

After activation, you can configure update intervals per post type.  
When settings are saved, the plugin can immediately trigger an update and then continue running automatically according to your defined schedule.

You can choose whether to update:

- The publish date  
- The modified date  

An optional variance setting slightly randomizes timestamps to avoid identical update patterns.

3. Navigate to "Update Refresher" in the admin menu  
4. Configure your scheduling preferences

The plugin will then operate automatically according to your defined intervals.
